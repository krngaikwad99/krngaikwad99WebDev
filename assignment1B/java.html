              Java is actually the language I have spent the most time on and done the best with. It's definitely my most proficient language and I've done the best in my Java classes overall. If I had to make a project, I would undoubtedly do it in Java and the biggest projects I have already completed have been in this language. I can't say there's something I love about it because honestly speaking, I feel like it's the only language I really know well so I can't say if I like it because I do or because it's all I know.

              Since Java is my most proficient language, I decided it might be beneficial to provide some of my best projects with this langauge. My biggest project is a Course Registration System. I created this for an assignment I had to complete for Data Structures. By utilizing object oriented programming, serialization, inheritence, and knowledge of abstract classes, I was able to create a system which would hold a lot of information about individual students. I received a 100 on the assignment and was very proud. Another project I completed was a Phonebook application system which used similar aspects of Java, but was significantly easier than the Course Registration System.
