              Python is the first programming language that I ever learned. I took it in Intro to Computer Programming. I had no knowledge of coding before I took it. It's the introductory course at NYU and looking back, it's actually a pretty easy language. Despite that, however, I wasn't really able to do that well in that course because I had a lot of things going on that semester. I kind of regret not learning more since it's one of the most basic languages that focuses on simplicity actually. If you want to hear an interesting video about the evolution of Python over the next few years, click below! It's long so I haven't given it too much time but maybe it will interest you. The audio is from a youtube video by "Real Python", an interesting youtube channel with over 60k subscribers. All credit goes to them.
