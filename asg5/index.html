          <h1 id=special> This is the first part of my assignment. It's the style application!</h1>
          
          <div class=highlight>
          <h3> To provide content, I'll be talking about some of my favorite clothes. </h3>
          </div>
          
          <p> My favorite article of clothing is a hoodie that I lost. It was a light blue "Good Enough" hoodie by a youtuber named Nathan Zedd. I'm a huge fan of Nathan, and I purchased the hoodie a while back for its message. It's supposed to remind people not to worry about other people's standards or expectations, because you are in fact, good enough. Unfortunately, I lost it on a trip with my friends.</p>
              
          <p> My second favorite article of clothing is my collection of flannels. I like flannel shirts, and they are more special to me because a close friend of mine bought me multiple in my collection. Currently I only have 4 flannels, but I would be happy to get more colors </p>
          
          <p> Lastly, my third favorite article of clothing are my black joggers. I got these with my pledge brothers in my fraternity. We all got the same pair. It's a nice momentum of our unity, and they are super comfortable. I enjoy taking tests in them. </p>
