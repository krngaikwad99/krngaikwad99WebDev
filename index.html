        Hello! Welcome to my page. My name is Karan Gaikwad, I am a student at NYU. I major in Computer Science, with a minor in Business Studies. Click on my picture below if you want to see one of my favorite videos ever! It's a song by Lil Uzi Vert. It always makes me feel better when I'm down. I don't really have much else to share but I hope you have a nice day. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vi2XaiKhgiU"> Or if you don't wanna click on the picture you can click here too!</a>
